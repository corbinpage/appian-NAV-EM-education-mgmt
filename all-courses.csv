This session emphasizes the importance on interdisciplinary care for patients at the end of life. A variety of teaching methods will be used including lecture, assigned reading, team-based learning, small group interactions, and use of standardized patients providing formative small group learning with feedback.  During this session, you will participate in a hospice home or inpatient visit and have time for self-reflection.  We are hopeful students will take away from this TIME in palliative care a greater sense of the issues that physicians face when working with patients with life threatening illness and are approaching death.  We fully understand that students may have not had significant experiences with patients confronting these issues, or have personal experiences with death in one’s family or social circle.  We seek to impress upon the students that Palliative Care is a discipline upon itself, with special skill sets that can be developed and enriched, all the while being integrated in everyday medicine.","Our Course Objectives seek to:1) Differentiate between palliative care and hospice 2) Recognize that specific skills can be acquired in order to deliver good palliative care  3) Outline an approach to symptom management considering patient’s goals and disease status4) Establish a framework for communicating bad news to individuals and their families5) Give examples of the multidimensional aspects of palliative care 6) Appreciate the role of the physician in the interdisciplinary team in delivering palliative care7) Examine one’s personal response to caring for the dying patient ",Medicine,2015-2016,3,1/11/16,5/27/16,Complete25,Patient Safety,"TheTIMEPatientSafetyCoursehasthreegoals:1. To describe how medical errors may occur, how we can learn from them, and how we can prevent their recurrence at the healthcare provider level, team level, and system level.2.

While their etiology remains unknown, several mechanistic theories have been proposed throughout the last decades. Understanding how these theories have evolved is the major goal of this topic. Here, we will review experimental work generated from the early 1900’s to the most recent studies linking autoimmunity and cancer. Ashwin Balagopal and Justin Bailey: Innate Immune Evasion in Viral InfectionInnate immunity has been recognized as a critical defense against invading pathogens; nonetheless, viruses successfully circumvent innate immunity to establish acute or chronic infection in the mammalian host.  Moreover, triggering of innate immunity in the host may lead to untoward consequences.  In this sequence of small-group sessions, we will explore the various pathways by which viruses stimulate and evade innate immune defenses.  In particular, we will use the primary literature to find links between viral proteins with their host molecular targets, focusing on the clinical consequences of immune evasion.","Students will explore the causes of cytokine storm and its implications for the pathogenesis of infections disease.  We will begin with a discussion of toxic shock syndromes and bacterial superantigens and proceed to the themes of inflammatory cytokine release in severe influenza, ebola and malaria.
